## Software Engineering
### INTRO
**Software of 21st century:**
1. Embedded in virtual lives. Grown dramatic interest into software in the last years because of that.
2. The information technology requirements demanded by everyone increased. Large teams build computer programs that in the past were built by a single developer.
3. Individuals, business, and gov increasingly rely on software for strategic and tactical decision making, or day to day operations. 
4. As the application grows software should be maintainable.

**What is it?** A process or collection of methods with an array of tools that allows pros toi build high quality computer software.
**Who does it?** Software engineers.
**Why is it important?** Enables us to build complex systems in a timely manner and with high quality. It imposes discipline to work that can be chaotic, but it also allows people who built computer software to adapt their approach in a manner that best suits their needs.
**What are the steps?** Apply an agile, adaptable process that leads to a high-quality result that meets the needs of users.
**What is the work product?** Set of programs, data, and other work products that are computer software.

### DEFINING THE DISCIPLINE
The definition:
> Software Engineering : (1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software. (2) The study of approaches as in (1). 
Some approaches might work for some people but not for others. Therefore we need discipline, but we also need adaptability and agility.
The value that supports software enginering is a quality focus.
