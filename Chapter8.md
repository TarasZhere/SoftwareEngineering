# Requirement Engineering Tasks
There are 7 steps that require Engineering process.
**Which will be on the exam**.
These tasks lead to an understanding of what the business impact of the software will be, what the customer wants, and how end users will interact with the software. Requirements begins with **Inception**, *A task that defines the nature of the problem needed to be solved*. **Elicitation**, *the step that help stake holder define what is required*. **Elaboration**, *where requirements are fined and modified*. **How do I ensure I have done right?** Stakeholders will ensure that you really have understood the problem.
Requirements engineering encompasses seven distinct tasks: inception, elicitation, elaboration, negotiation, specifi cation, validation, and management. It is important to note that some of these tasks occur in parallel and all are adapted to the needs of the project. 

## Inception 
How does a project get started? At project inception, you establish a basic understanding of the problem, the people who want a solution, the nature of the solution that is desired, and the effectiveness of preliminary communication and collaboration between the other stakeholders and the software team.
- Identify the stakeholders
    - 'who else you should talk to?'
- Recognize multiple points of the users
- Collaborate to find different opinions
- First quesitons

## Elicitation 
An important part of elicitation is to establish business goals. Your job is to engage stakeholders and to encourage them to share their goals honestly. Once the goals have been captured, a prioritization mechanism should be established, and a design rationale for a potential architecture (that meets stakeholder goals) can be created. 

### Eliciting Requirements
Basic guidelines:
- meet with customers and software ingeneering 
- rules for partetipation
- agenda
- someone controls the meeting
- use worksheet or similar
- the goal is:
    - identify the problems
    - propose solution
    - negotiate approaches
    - spec. set of solution requirements

### Elicitation work producs
### Building the Analysis Model
one of the most important topic
The model is :
- scenario-based elem
- class-based elem
- behavioral elem
- flow-oriented elem

## Elaboration
The information obtained from the customer during inception and elicitation is expanded and refi ned during elaboration. Elaboration is driven by the creation and refi nement of user scenarios that describe how the end user (and other actors) will interact with the system.

## Negotiation
It isnâ€™t unusual for customers and users to ask for more than can be achieved, given limited business resources. You have to reconcile these confl icts through a process of negotiation.

## Specification
In the context of computer-based systems (and software), the term specifi cation means different things to different people. A specifi cation can be a written document, a set of graphical models, a formal mathematical model, a collection of usage scenarios, a prototype, or any combination of those.

## Validation
As each element of the requirements model is created, it is examined for inconsistency, omissions, and ambiguity.

## Use case
> A collection of user scenarios that describes the thread of usage of a system
