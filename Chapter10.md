> The designer's task is to discover structures that make it possible to implement the requirements.

Look for nouns in the prblem description. Any noun that we see it could be a potential **class name**. 
Next could be verbs are potential methonds.

|User|Validate|

|User is the class name|Validate is a function of the class|

**It is a good idea to keep a list of the canditae classes.**
Not all classes can be discovered by the description.
